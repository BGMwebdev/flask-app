        "description": "Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield', which would remain with him even in death.",

Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company. Some readers have pointed out that Fíli and Kíli are the only two Dwarves of Thorin's company to die at the Battle of Five Armies, despite being treated more sympathetically by J.R.R. Tolkien than the rest. From this perspective, the 'singling out' of Fíli and Kíli for death appears unusual. There are two possible (and not mutually exclusive) explanations for why Tolkien chose to treat these characters in this way.",

He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.",

In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old. In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as 'simpletons' and also said that Hobbits 'would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell",

Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.",

Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.",

Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River. Undeterred, Gandalf continued in his plan, sending thirteen Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield, to Bag End the very day. These Dwarves, needing an additional member for their company, initially came by pairs, and lastly with Gandalf, who had himself selected Bilbo as the best person for the Dwarves' job. The Dwarves explained to Bilbo their background and purpose; that they were among the Dwarves of Erebor who had been forced from the Lonely Mountain when the dragon Smaug attacked and taken up residence there. They now had determined to reclaim the mountain and needed a 'burglar' to help them in situations requiring stealth. Bilbo reluctantly agreed to go, and the next morning they set off from the Green Dragon Inn.",
